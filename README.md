# Networking-projects
This repository contains hands on practice for network simulations to translate basic concepts from theory to practical.
Each folder in this repository represents a different project.
There is a topology snapshot from GNS3 in each folder that shows my network topology design. 
All configuration files of each device are saved as .cfg file.
